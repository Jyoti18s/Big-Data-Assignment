following require Smartdrive  using kind disk cache utility strongly recommended  makes Windows run much  much faster  1  ASPI4DOSSYS driver  need ASPI functions  controlling CDROM  tape drive  two physical hard disks  etc    add SCSIHASYS driver CONFIGSYS file  eg   DRIVERc  SCSIHASYS V386  Windows needs  V386  option   driver MUST loaded LOW memory  loaded high memory   occupies 1620K  November 1992  SCSIHASYS driver could obtained Adaptec BBS  408  9457727  hopefully  still   2  need ASPI functions ASPI4DOSSYS driver  version 30 30a  use ASPI4DOSSYS SCSIHASYS drivers CONFIGSYS file  eg   DRIVERc  ASPI4DOSSYS DRIVERc  SCSIHASYS V386 Amazingly enough  SCSIHASYS driver also loaded high  assuming DOS 50   would thought would crash system  nt  asked Adaptec s technical support  said loading SCSIHASYS high fine long ASPI4DOSSYS loaded LOW  system  using SCSIHASYS ASPI4DOS 30a would occasionally cause Windows 31 crash upon restarting exiting Windows  additional result corrupted disk  C  WINDOWS  GRP files would corrupted    crashes usually occurred making different program PROGMANEXE default Windows shell  viceversa  reason SCSIHASYS may necessary  absolutely idea SCSIHASYS necessary versions ASPI4DOS earlier 30  Note many people use ASPI4DOS 30 30a without SCSIHASYS  seem problems  consider people lucky  Others  like  sorts problems  3  opinion  best  necessarily easiest  solution upgrade ASPI4DOS 31  SCSIHASYS driver longer needed  Unfortunately  could get previous ASPI4DOS upgrades Adaptec BBS  ASPI4DOS 31 driver available Adaptec BBS  far know  three ways get copy   buy new  November 1992  Adaptec EZ SCSI driver kit  supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 31 well drivers  CDROM drivers  believe list price around  75   already copy older version ASPI4DOS  supposedly contact Adaptec upgrade EZ SCSI around  30   copy ASPI4DOS 31 included Central Point PC Tools 80 MSDOS  Note documentation driver stored different directories  Note ASPI4DOS included  CDROM drivers drivers support two hard disks included  obtained copy ASPI4DOS 31  Note  however  getting occasional parity errors Windows  probability  defective hardware PC causing  upgraded motherboard found solutions  However  parity errors occur disk accesses  small  definite  possibility parity errors driverrelated  example  changing bus onoff timing certain disk transfers might cause   ve run various memory tests hours time  tests found problems  problem probably caused memory marginal timing requirements  cause parity errors disk transfers  memory tests nt find problems  problems show disk IO   However  m mentioning case nt hardware problem       Floppycontrollerbased tape backup devices  two possible problems using Adaptec 1542 floppycontrollerbased tape backup device  Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo 250  1  Tape backupsrestores take long time  tape drive constantly starts  stops  starts  stops  etc  2  Tape operations may erratic  encounter many tape errors   problem might caused defective hardware 1542  However  ve heard people similar problems  m mentioning case hardware problem 1542    Tape backupsrestores take long time  floppycontrollerbased tape backup device  may adjust Adaptec 15401542  bus onoff timing  best results using tape drive  Normally  tape backup restore  tape drive motor continuously running  occasional pause  However  default bus timing Adaptec 15401542 may cause tape drive motor start stop  start stop  every seconds  causes needless wear tape tape drive  however  note dirty tape head defective tape drive also cause  make sure tape heads clean   also causes tape backup restore take much  much longer necessary  problem tape backups use floppy DMA transfer data memory tofrom tape drive  Adaptec uses DMA transfer data memory tofrom hard disk  floppy DMA needs feed data tape drive certain rate  tape drive fed data quickly enough floppy DMA  tape drive stops  rewinds bit  restarts  enough data eventually fed   default bus timing Adaptec  really DMA timing   large   example  backup done  data transferred hard disk memory  memory tape  default timing Adaptec  hogs  memory much  much time spent transferring data hard disk memory   enough time spent transferring data memory tape drive  result  tape drive constantly starts stops  data fed quickly enough  solution change Adaptec s bus onoff timing  default factory setting 11 microseconds  5 microseconds   bus  timing needs lowered 24 microseconds  done one two ways   ASPI4DOS  use  n  option  example  use  bus  timing 4 microseconds  means use following line CONFIGSYS file  DEVICEc  aspi4dossys n4 Note space  n   4    nt ASPI4DOS  recourse try find program called  SETSCSIEXE   difficult find  reason Adaptec  reasons  seem want widely distributed  asked someone worked Adaptec  asked upload anywhere  anonymous ftp access Internet  could try using archie hunt copy  believe couple sites  find copy  run like  setscsi n4 adjusts  bus  timing 4 microseconds  Running SETSCSIEXE without arguments resets bus timing back factory defaults  Note seems use SETSCSIEXE use ASPI4DOS  SETSCSIEXE crashed system ASPI4DOS loaded  could use SETSCSIEXE SCSIHASYS  however  lower  bus  timing 2 microseconds  increase 11 microseconds  lower low  hard disk throughput suddenly drop  system feel slower   4 microseconds works fine  value may work fine  may adjust downwards little  ve lowered  bus  timing  tape backups restores run faster  Also  experiment bus onoff times  options intentionally described   unless know  Bad combinations cause parity errors worse  starving memory refresh  program called BUSTIFIXEXE exists Adaptec BBS  Unless upgraded since last checked    selfextracting archive containing batch file couple files  batch file supposed allow one set bus onoff times 15401542 others  However  tried running program 1542A  system crashed  time  running SCSIHASYS  nt check see conflict  Maybe old program works 1542B  although docs say works 1542A   Erratic tape operations many tape errors   problem  may may exist  Although existed system  hardware problem particular 1542 could cause  However  ve heard people similar problems  Im mentioning case nt hardware problem 1542  Symptoms  problem   persists even cleaning tape head  1  Backing tape encounters  unusable sector detected  errors  resulting aborted tape backup  2  Tape backup works  tape compare fails  3  tape drive starts  stops  starts  stops  etc  much often  Unlike abovementioned problem   Tape backupsrestores take long time    tape drive starts stops every seconds  kind startingstopping occurs every 1020 seconds  4  Fastback Plus 31 findsee tape backup devices  programs  like Central Point Backup CMS Jumbo software  assuming CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive  findsee tape drive  Fastback Plus 31  5  many tape read errors  Although know causing problem  discovered using different floppy controller solves  months ago  upgraded motherboard  contained integrated floppy controller  already floppy controller 1542  initially disabled motherboard floppy controller   decided try disabling 1542 floppy controller using one motherboard   tape drive  CMS Jumbo 250  reliability increased dramatically  Fastback Plus 31 suddenly able find use tape drive  nt know caused hardware problem 1542  one hand  floppy drives worked great attached 1542  seems say nothing wrong 1542  hand  tape drive nt work well attached 1542 floppy controller  work attached different controller  could indication hardware problem 1542  change floppy drive cables  conceivable problem cables  nt know cause really  however  re similar problems  might want consider trying new floppy controller       Sound cards  Many popular sound cards play record digitized sound  typically done using DMA  Like tape drive DMA  Adaptec s DMA conflict sound card DMA  Unlike tape DMA   conflict  usually manifests parity error  system crashes parity error message   happens  data transferred quickly sound card Adaptec  memory refresh occur quickly enough  causes parity error  Usually  getting parity error means hardware problem system  case  however  parity error symptom bad hardware  ve found parity errors typically occur recording digitized sound  chances errors increase increase recording fidelity  eg  higher sampling rate  recording stereo  recording using 16bits instead 8  etc   Like tape drive solution  solution lower Adaptec s  bus  timing  See section tape drives information done  Note  however  may may solve problem  may reduce probability parity error  software used record digitized sound greatly affect problem  ie  software inefficient   Disk caches  speed hard disk  amount disk fragmentation also affect       Miscellaneous info  section contains miscellaneous hints  tips  rumors  Much merely information ve heard read  verified  believe following information correct  Im sure  Use risk   QEMM 600  601  602  need specify  DB  parameter  eg   DB2    unless

agnosticism  coined Professor Huxley meeting Metaphysical Society 1876  defined agnostic someone disclaimed   strong   atheism believed ultimate origin things must cause unknown unknowable  Thus agnostic someone believes know sure whether God exists  Words slippery things  language inexact  Beware assuming work someone s philosophical point view simply fact calls atheist agnostic  example  many people use agnosticism mean  weak atheism   use word  atheism  referring  strong atheism   Beware also word  atheist  many shades meaning  difficult generalize atheists  say sure atheists nt

atheists would reluctant state certainty universe exists  Faith also used refer belief without supporting evidence proof  Sceptical atheism certainly nt fit definition  sceptical atheism beliefs  Strong atheism closer  still nt really match  even dogmatic atheist tend refer experimental data  lack  asserting God exist   atheism religious  surely s antireligious   unfortunate human tendency
